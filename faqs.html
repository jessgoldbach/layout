        <h1>How do you research your trips and what sources do you use?</h1>
        <p1>A lot of times Google can help you with research! But it is also important to check out other resources like <a href="http://midatlantic.aaa.com/Travel/Overview?zip=08628&devicecd=PC&referer=travel.aaa.com">AAA</a> and reliable websites where travelers share their experiences like <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/">Trip Advisor</a>.</p1>
         <h1>What type of travel destination is your favorite?</h1>
        <p1>I really can't pick a favorite destination. They are all really awesome places to go visit. I would have to say that recently I have developed a love for those huge mountains on the West Coast of the US. When I first saw them in California in 2011 I was in love. Then, this past summer I fell in love with them again when exploring Alaska!</p1>
         <h1>So far, what was your favorite place you have visitied in the USA?</h1>
        <p1>Probably California. It's such a huge state and there is so much to do. They have beaches, cities, deserts, and mountains! I really want to go back sometime in the near near future.</p1>
         <h1>Do you travel back to destinations after you have been there before?</h1>
        <p1>Oh yea! It's impossible to see everything you want in just one visit!</p1>
         <h1>What has been your favorite beach vacation?</h1>
        <p1>Every beach is amazingly relaxing! But I would say Hawaii is near the top of the list!</p1>
         <h1>What has been your favorite thing about traveling to Europe?</h1>
        <p1>I have only been there once, but there is just so much history over there. We also have family in England, so it's always nice to visit them.</p1>
         <h1>What is your favorite mode of travel?</h1>
        <p1>Hmmm, that's a hard one. I honestly like everything. Planes, boats, cars, walking, horses! Haha. I do enjoy having our own cars because it allows you the freedom to go where you want to go and stop along the road as many times you want! The only hard thing is someone always has to drive and can't always take in all the scenery like the person in the back seat can.</p1>
        <h1>What are the hardest things about traveling with your family, and how do you handle it?</h1>
            <p1>They get annoying! Traveling with anyone can be hard, but really all the experiences and memories you make outweigh anything negative. It's always nice to have a plan so you can avoid any problems.</p1>
